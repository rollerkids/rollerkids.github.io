	    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Gloria Chu, currently a Seniorita at Arcadia High School. I have developed a passion for rollerblading since the fourth grade, and I am wonderfully excited to be able to share this enjoyable hobby with y’all through this club! I have also loved working with kids since as long as I can remember, from babysitting my four baby cousins to volunteering regularly at the Nursery School in Methodist Hospital as well as the Critter Camp at Pasadena Humane Society. As President, please feel free to contact me personally at gchu2001@gmail.com if you have any questions, or want to know more about our club!</p>
	    <p>*I am also fluent in Mandarin, so please don’t hesitate to contact me in Chinese!</p>

	    <p>Hey folks! I’m Sandra Tang, an Arcadia High School senior who likes computer science, graphic design, and helping others. I highly value a balanced lifestyle and staying healthy, so I hope to keep kids active through fun activities such as roller skating. My siblings and I spent a good deal of our childhood biking, skateboarding, riding scooters, and, of course, roller skating. As On A Roll’s Communications Director, I combine my passions and skills to create and maintain the organization website, design posters, and oversee marketing.</p>

	    <p>Hey peeps! I’m Christina Lee, also an AHS senior. I love organizing my environment and making sure everything is perfect, not to mention how much I enjoy physical activities. I have learned fencing, surfing, skiing, ice skating, playing tennis and badminton, swimming, and dancing. Rollerblading is a very new concept to me, so I hope through this club, I can master the art of rollerblading. As the secretary of "On the Roll" Athletics Club, I hope to contribute my passion for sports and data collecting to improve this club for the better.</p>

	    <p>Hello there! I’m Calvin, and I’ll be a senior in AHS! I like science, history, video games, and doing things that have no relation to my schoolwork for extended periods of time. I learned how to ice skate back in Middle School, so I can kind of roller skate, but I’ll be on my bike more often than not. I’ve volunteered at St. Francis Medical Center and the American Military Museum, and I love to work with others and kids! As the club historian and treasurer, I’ll be working mostly behind the scenes to help everything go smoothly, but I’ll be there for you if you ever need any help! You can contact me at calvintn01@gmail.com if you have any questions!</p>
