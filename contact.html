        	<h3>FAQ</h3>
            <br>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Do we need to buy our own roller skates and protection equipment?</p>
            <p>A: Because of the sheer variety of skates on the market, it is best for all attendees to purchase and personalize their own rollerblades. If you have questions or want recommendations, please check our website or email the club gmail! Protective gear (e.g. elbow pads and knee pads) will be provided, but please buy your own helmet.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Q: What should we bring to each meeting?</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Who will be teaching?</p>
            <p>A: High School students (between the grades of 9th-12th) with personal experience in skating and working with kids will be involved in the instruction of rollerblading. If you are an interested and passionate high school student, we invite you to fill out the “Rollerblading Mentor” google form on our website to join our club! </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Is this safe?</p>
            <p>A: Yes! Only high school students that have been thoroughly interviewed and screened for positive attitudes and good behavior are allowed to teach the kids. However, common scrapes and injuries may still occur, so it is crucial for the guardian of the attendee(s) to complete the needed forms on the website/email. The club officers will have a basic first aid kit on hand, but it is best if the parent is there in case of emergency.</p>

            <p>A: Nope! The Roller Kids’ Club is a completely non-profit organization, and attendees will not be charged for lessons. Donations and help, however, are entirely welcome and appreciated!</p>

            <p>A: The age range for potential students is 8 years to 13 years old. Parents and guardians are welcome to attend. If you are a high school student, and is interested in contributing to the club, please fill out the “Rollerblading Mentor” application on our website to join/teach! </p>
